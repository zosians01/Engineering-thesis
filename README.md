For my engineering thesis I have designed a device to help blind animals in their day to day life. 
I used ToF sensors along side vibrating motors and Arduino Uno as a microcontroller.
ToF sensors would detect any obstacles and warn the animal with vibrations.
I also used a 3 axis accelerometr to detect in which position the animal currently is, in order to avoid ground while leasuring.
The design was fully created by me, beging with electrical ciruit (KiCad) to programming. 
I didn't have a chance to test it on real animal so I can't confirm it's usefulness in real life scenarios.
